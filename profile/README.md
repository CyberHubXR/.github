## Hi 👋 We are Foundry!

Foundry, is an open source multiplayer VR Unity template designed to help developers create a more fair and enjoyable metaverse for creators and users.

We want to prove that making a multiplayer VR game doesn't have to be hard...

Our template is maintained by a team of experienced VR developers and comes with a custom VR rig, sample scripts, and integration with Photon multiplayer. With the ability to support up to 40 players in one instance, our template is also equipped with ready-to-use social VR assets. It's the perfect starting point for your VR project.
