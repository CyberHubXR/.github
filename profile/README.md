## Hi 👋 We're CyberHub!

CyberHub is a studio dediated to making XR multiplayer as easy as possible, one of the ways we're trying to do this is with Foundry.

Foundry, is an open source multiplayer VR Unity template designed to help developers create a more fair and enjoyable metaverse for creators and users.

We want to prove that making a multiplayer VR game doesn't have to be hard...

Our template is maintained by a team of experienced VR developers and comes with a custom VR rig, sample scripts, and integration with Photon multiplayer. With the ability to support up to 40 players in one instance, our template is also equipped with ready-to-use social VR assets. It's the perfect starting point for your VR project.
